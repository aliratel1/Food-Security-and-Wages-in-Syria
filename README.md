## 📖 Overview  
The Syrian economy has faced severe challenges over the past decade. Currency depreciation, rising food prices, and widespread poverty have pushed millions into food insecurity.  

This project analyzes:  
- 📉 The depreciation of the Syrian pound against the US dollar.  
- 🥖 The cost of an **essential food basket** (~2,100 kcal/day per person).  
- 💰 Comparison of **food costs vs. the statutory minimum wage**.  
- ⛽ The impact of rising **household gas cylinder and transport costs**.  
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Implications for individuals and households.  

The report combines **price datasets** with official data from WFP, UNDP, and ILO to provide a realistic picture of affordability and food security in Syria.

## 🔑 Key Findings  
- The Syrian pound lost nearly **97% of its value** against the USD between 2011 and 2025.  
- From 2020 to 2024, the cost of essential food exceeded the minimum monthly wage.  
- In 2025, wages increased by 200%, but rising **gas cylinder (+226%)** and **transport costs (+185%)** erased much of the gain.  
- For families, food alone often consumes more than one worker’s income → reliance on **multiple jobs** or **humanitarian aid**.

## 🌍 Context & Importance  
Food security is one of the most pressing challenges in Syria.  
According to UNDP and WFP reports:   
- **90% of Syrians live under the poverty line**.  
- Minimum wages rarely cover even the most basic nutritional needs.  

This report contributes to understanding the **gap between income and essential costs** — a key issue in humanitarian aid, and economic recovery.
